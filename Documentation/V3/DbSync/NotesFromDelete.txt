- do we need to have cuttingUnitID and StratumID in the CuttingUnit_Stratum table
if CuttingUnitCode and StratumCode are different from Source to destination

- PlotLocation_Tombstone needs CruiseID or we need to join with Plot_tombstone to get cruiseID
	- one solution would be to sync deletes in the same method as plots
	then we would have the plot ID without needing to join with Plot_tombstone
	A plotLocation_Tombstone should not exist without a plot_tombstone
	this would also be a good solution for FixCNTSubPop
	, TreeMeasurements, TreeLocation, TreeFieldValue

 - sync should ensure tree has not been deleted or fail gracefully 
 when syncing/inserting treelocation

 - should we remove deletion tracking for TreeMeasurments, TreeLocation, TreeFieldValue, PlotLocation
   These records shouldn't have a way for the user to delete them. Maybe we should keep deletion tracking
   for the purpose of being able to recover data but not use deletion tracking in the sync process

 - Log and Stem tombstone table needs a cruiseID field or the tombstone table does
