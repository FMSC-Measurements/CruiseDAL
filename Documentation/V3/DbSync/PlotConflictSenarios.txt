# Plot Conflict Senarios
Senario:
 User enters plots and tree data for a given existing unit from paper into two files.
Variations:
  - User enters more tree data on a plot into one file. 
  - User enters an aditional plot into one file.
Setup
 File A contains
	Plots: 
		PlotNumber
		1,
		2,
	Trees:
		Plot Number |Tree Number
		1			|1
		1			|2
		2			|1
 File B contains
	Plots: 
		PlotNumber
		1
		2
	Trees:
		Plot Number |Tree Number
		1			|1
		1			|2
		2			|1

Conflict Analisis:
	Each plot that exists in both files will generate a conflict. As well
	the trees in those plots will generate downstream conflicts.
	We can analize the plot conflict and downstream conflicts and check them for sameness.
	If all downstream conflicts are same, then we can determin that a chose resolution is best.
	- for plot record. we may not be able to resonably compare the remarks field due to the dificulty of 		having exact same plot remarks

Analisis:
	The data in both files should be the same. 
	With the posibility that one file contains more tree records on a given plot.
	The user has two options 
	Chosing to take all the data for a plot based on which plot record is newer is probably the best option
	
	
Senario:
	User colects plots into two files, but forgets to enter corect plot numbers and gets conflicts on plot numbers
	
Setup
 File A contains
	Plots: 
		PlotNumber
		1,
		2,
	Trees:
		Plot Number |Tree Number
		1			|1
		1			|2
		2			|1
 File B contains
	Plots: 
		PlotNumber
		1
		2
	Trees:
		Plot Number |Tree Number
		1			|1
		1			|2
		2			|1
	
Conflict Analisis:
	Each plot that exists in both files will generate a conflict. As well
	the trees in those plots will generate downstream conflicts.
	Plots and downstream conflicts will generaly fail checks for sameness, because measurments will be different.
	Unless there were no samples on the trees, but then the tally-pop on those trees should not be exact.
	Since the child data is different we can conclude that these are seperate plots and a modify resolution should 
	be chosen.
