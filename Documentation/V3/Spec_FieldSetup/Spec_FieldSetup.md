## Default Values 
Allow setting default values for fields that will be applied to each tree.
This will supplement the features of TreeDefaultValues. Allowing users to 
set up default values on fields without creating new species codes.

## Hidden Fields
With the addition of the ability to use field setup to define default values
users may want to set up a field but not make it editable in FScruiser. 
 
We can have a button in FScruiser that allow hidden fields to be shown. 
This is useful for fields that only be edited on a low percentage of trees. 


## Expand field setup to the Samplegroup and Sub-population level
Having field setup at the sampleGroup and sub-population level will allow users 
to apply default values at the sub-population level without the need to create 
special species codes.
